# Retail Sales Performance Dataset

Welcome to my retail sales performance dataset repository! This collection of data is packed with insights into sales trends, product performance, and profitability metrics—everything you need to dive into retail analytics.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset is organized into three sheets:

1. **business.retailsales**: The heart of the dataset, containing detailed sales data.
2. **Analysis&KPI**: A snapshot of the big picture with key performance indicators (KPIs).
3. **Dashboard**: Visual summaries to make the data come alive (still a work in progress).

Here’s what you’ll find in this sheet:

- **Product Type**: The category of products sold, such as Art & Sculpture or Basket.
- **Net Quantity**: How many units were sold.
- **Gross Sales**: Total revenue before adjustments.
- **Discounts**: The amount of discounts applied.
- **Returns**: Refunds for returned items.
- **Total Net Sales**: Revenue after factoring in discounts and returns.
- **Gross Margin**: The profit after deducting costs.
- **Average Order Value**: Average revenue per order.

This sheet is perfect for understanding the raw data and uncovering trends.

It’s great for getting a quick overview without crunching all the numbers yourself.
